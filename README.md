 <!-- Unit 4: OOP Game Show App / PHRASE HUNTER GAME -->

<!-- GOAL: EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS -->

<!-- ABOUT THIS GAME: This is a game where the players will try to guess the correct letters in the hidden phrase with only 5 wrong misses allowed. As correct guesses are made, those letters will appear in their placeholders. After the game is won or lost, the page will reload a new game with a key press.-->

<!-- I've added additional functionality so the user can use their keyboard to type in sync with the keys on the computer screen. They may also press the 'Enter' key when the gamestart and finish overlays are present - which will count as though there was an actual mouse click. -->

<!-- I have about 30 random phrases, and also an option for infinite games to be played if I manually go in and unhide the automatic reload code when the winner loses. -->

<!-- This was an awesome project, and I wish I had more time to make it pretty. I wanted to add red hello kitty bows instead of hearts, do some font changes on the overlay, etc. I just might come back and do so in the future. -->

<!-- Thank you for reading!!!! -->
